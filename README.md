### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**FanMclaine/FanMclaine** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Mclnootdev_ (idk... this work never existed)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on game development (not on Unity smh) and video editing
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing/nobody
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nobody
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about my goals
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: nothing
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computer motherboards are expensive because of the materials used
